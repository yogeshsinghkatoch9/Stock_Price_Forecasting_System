Stock Price Forecasting System: Technical Workflow
===============================================

1. Data Collection & Initial Processing
------------------------------------
def download_stock_data():
    - Downloads 7 years of historical data for specified tickers
    - Extracts OHLCV (Open, High, Low, Close, Volume) data
    
def preprocess_data():
    - Handles missing values using forward fill
    - Ensures business day frequency
    - Interpolates gaps linearly : (Linear interpolation fills missing values in data by drawing straight lines between known points. For two points (x₁,y₁) and (x₂,y₂), any point (x,y) between them is calculated using:y = y₁ + (x - x₁) * (y₂ - y₁)/(x₂ - x₁))

2. Feature Engineering Pipeline
----------------------------
def add_features():
    - Calculates basic technical indicators:
        * Returns
        * Moving averages (MA20, MA50)
        * Price momentum
        * Volume averages

        * RSI  : RSI (Relative Strength Index): Momentum indicator measuring speed/change of price movements, scaled 0-100. Overbought >70, oversold <30.
        * MACD : MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence): Shows trend direction/momentum using differences between fast/slow moving averages.
        * OBV  : OBV (On-Balance Volume): Cumulative volume indicator showing buying/selling pressure through volume flow.
        * Stochastic : Compares current price to price range over time period, indicating overbought (>80) or oversold (<20) conditions.
        ( Signal potential entry/exit points 
          Identify overbought/oversold conditions 
          Confirm price trends
          Measure trading momentum 
          Detect market reversals )
        

def add_advanced_features():
    - Generates advanced market indicators:
        * Log price transforms : Convert price movements to percentage changes for better statistical analysis
        * Multi-period volatility : Measures price variability across different timeframes to assess risk
        * Moving average crossovers : Trading signals when shorter-term average crosses longer-term average
        * Bollinger Bands : Shows price volatility with standard deviation bands around moving average
        * Volume ratios : Compare current trading volume to historical averages to confirm price moves

3. Model Training Process
-----------------------
Data Split:
    - 70% Training
    - 15% Validation
    - 15% Testing

Model Architecture:
    a) LSTM/GRU Models
        - Sequence length: 60 days
        - Multiple LSTM/GRU layers with dropout
        - Early stopping and learning rate reduction
        ( * Processes 60-day sequences of market data
          * Uses multiple deep learning layers with dropout to prevent overfitting
          * Automatically adjusts training based on performance )
)
    
    b) Statistical Models
        - ARIMA: Auto-tuned parameters  (Time series forecasting with auto-optimized parameters)
        - GARCH: Volatility forecasting (Specifically predicts volatility/risk)
        - Prophet: Trend decomposition  (Breaks down data into trend, seasonal, and residual components)
    
    c) XGBoost
        - Uses lagged features (Takes previous time periods as features)
        - Recursive prediction (Makes predictions iteratively, using each prediction as input for next prediction)

4. Ensemble Mechanism
-------------------
def weighted_ensemble_forecast():
    - Collects predictions from all models
    - Weights based on validation MSE
    - Temperature scaling for weight calculation (Temperature controls how random or focused predictions are - like adjusting how "creative" vs "safe" the model's choices will be.)
    - Minimum weight threshold: 0.1  (filtered out to avoid small position sizes.)
    
def train_meta_model():
        (A meta-model in this context combines predictions from multiple models (LSTM, GRU, etc.) into a final forecast using linear regression. Here's how it works:
         Initial Models: Each base model (LSTM, GRU) makes predictions on validation data
         Training Process:
         Input: Predictions from each model [LSTM_pred, GRU_pred]
         Target: Actual stock prices
         Method: Linear regression learns optimal weights for combining predictions)

    - Linear regression for final combination 
    - Trained on validation predictions

5. Evaluation & Visualization
--------------------------
def plot_forecasts():
    - Training/validation/test visualization
    - Individual model comparisons
    - Ensemble forecast plotting

def visualize_results():
    - Error distribution analysis
    - Actual vs predicted scatter plots
    - Performance metrics calculation (MAE, MSE, RMSE)

Main Execution Flow:
------------------
run_forecasting_pipeline():
    1. Downloads data for specified tickers
    2. Processes and engineers features
    3. Trains all models independently
    4. Creates ensemble predictions  
    5. Visualizes results and performance

Example Usage:
------------
run_forecasting_pipeline(
    tickers=["AAPL", "GOOGL", "MSFT"], : Stock symbols to analyze
    years=7,                           : Downloads 7 years of historical data
    seq_length=40,                     : Uses 40 days of data to predict next day's price
    train_frac=0.85,                   : Uses 85% of data for training
    val_frac=0.1,                      : Uses 10% for validation (remaining 5% for testing)
    xgb_lags=20,                       : GBoost uses previous 20 days for prediction
    lstm_epochs=200,                   : Maximum training iterations for LSTM
    gru_epochs=200,                    : Maximum training iterations for GRU
    batch_size=6                       : Processes 6 samples at once during training
